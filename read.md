## Overview

This repository is used to connect to Meta Trader 5 and test how things work. These tests are for buying, selling and getting account information.
Login information is empty.

## Forex broker

For this testing I used [IC Market](https://www.icmarkets.com/global/en/) as a broker. This test uses a demo account for testing. 

## Current python tests

mtLogin.py shows how to log into the demo account. Once connected it contains a function to get historic data from mt5.
